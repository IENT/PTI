## Housekeeping
The overall process of maintenance is not trivial, as there is one [public repository](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/IENT/pti), which forms the basis for the lab. However, in the public repository the reference solution must not be stored. Therefore, a [fork](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/IENT-Internal/pti) exists in the IENT-internal namespace on git.rwth-aachen.de. This fork contains another branch (it is called ml for Musterl√∂sung). On this branch, the notebooks should also contain the reference solution. 

If something should be changed, the best practice would be to work on the ml branch and merge all relevant changes for the tasks itself into master. Be careful. This merge should be performed manually, as otherwise the reference solution would also end up on the master branch. After this process, a merge request to the public repo should be issued. After a code review the MR can be accepted. This process should ensure that the public repo remains clean. 

## Introduction

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the Praktikum Technische Informatik at RWTH Aachen University.

Visit the notebook [index.ipynb](index.ipynb) for a table of contents.

## Quick Start

Run the notebooks directly online [RWTHjupyter](https://jupyter.rwth-aachen.de): [![RWTHjupyter](https://jupyter.pages.rwth-aachen.de/documentation/images/badge-launch-rwth-jupyter.svg)](https://jupyter.rwth-aachen.de/hub/spawn?profile=pti&next=/user-redirect/lab/tree/pti%2Findex.ipynb)

* The starting process of the session may take up to one minute.

As a fall back: Use Binder or offline usage (see below).

## Binder

Run the notebooks directly online [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IENT/PTI.git/master?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb). Please note the following limitations:

* The starting process of the session may take up to one minute.
* Please note that the session will be cancelled after 10 minutes of user inactivity.


## Offline Usage

To be able to open the PTI notebooks locally, you need to have a Python environment as well as JupyterLab installed. We recommend to use Anaconda for a local installation.

### Anaconda

To run the notebooks on your local machine, you may use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (using `pip` is also possible for experienced users. You have to install all the requirements listed in `binder/environment.yml` and install the two `jupyter labextension ...` commands listed in `binder/postBuild`).

#### Installation

* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
* Download this repository to your local disk. You can download it as a zip-File or use `git`:  `git clone --recurse-submodules git@git.rwth-aachen.de:IENT/pti.git`.
* It is highly recommended to run the PTI notebooks in an isolated Anaconda environment. You can create a new environment called `ptilab` from the provided `binder/environment.yml` by running `conda env create -f binder/environment.yml` in the Anaconda prompt. This makes sure that all required packages are installed amd don't interfere with the packages in your base environment.
* Activate this environment with `conda activate ptilab`.
* Run two final commands in the Anaconda prompt (with activated `ptilab` environment):

  ```bash
  chmod +x binder/postBuild
  binder/postBuild
  ```

  If the latter command fails, please open `binder/postBuild` and execute the commands listed there manually.

#### Run

* Activate the environment  with `conda activate ptilab`.
* Run JupyterLab  `jupyter lab`. In your browser, JupyterLab should start. You can then open `index.ipynb` for an overview over all notebooks.
* You can deactivate the environment with `conda deactivate` (and switch back to it with `conda activate ptilab`).

### Docker

For advanced users only: If you happen to have Docker installed, you can start a local dockerized JupyterLab with enabled PTI with

```bash
docker run --name='pti' --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes registry.git.rwth-aachen.de/ient/pti:master
```
